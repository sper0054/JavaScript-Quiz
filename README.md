# JavaScript-Quiz
A timed quiz with five questions that will save high scores locally and allow you to clear the scores and/or retry taking the quiz.

## Description
When you click Start Quiz, the clock will begin counting down from 100 and you will be presented with the first question and multiple choice answers. When you guess the correct answer, correct! appears. When you guess incorrectly, incorrect! appears and 20 seconds is removed from the timer. Once all questions are answered or no time is left, you can type in your initials and submit your score (stored locally). Other options include retaking the quiz and clearing the high scores.
